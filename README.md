# Keygen + Electron Example

⚠️ **We've put together a new, updated example here: https://github.com/keygen-sh/example-electron-license-activation** ⚠️

This is a minimal Electron application integrated with [Keygen](https://keygen.sh) to handle license key validation upon startup. It is based on the Quick Start Guide within the Electron documentation. For a more advanced user-profile licensing setup, and an example of how to use Keygen for auto updates, check out [our other Electron example app](https://github.com/keygen-sh/example-electron-app).

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start).

## To Use

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/keygen-sh/basic-example-electron-app
# Go into the repository
cd basic-example-electron-app
```

Next, install dependencies with [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.comg):
```
yarn
```

Then start the app:
```
yarn start
```

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
